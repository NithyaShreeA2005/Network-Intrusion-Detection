🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) built using IBM SkillsBuild & Watson.ai as part of my internship project.
This project detects suspicious activities and potential attacks in a network by analyzing patterns and classifying them as normal or malicious.

🚀 Features

🔍 Detects abnormal traffic patterns

📊 Machine Learning–based classification (Normal vs Intrusion)

🧠 Trained with IBM Watson AI models

⚡ Real-time detection support

📈 Visual representation of detection results⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/NithyaShreeA2005/Network-Intrusion-Detection.git


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the system:

python intrusion_detection.py
📊 Dataset

The project uses the [KDD Cup 99 / NSL-KDD dataset] (or your dataset name).

It contains labeled network traffic instances: Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R.

Preprocessed and used for training/testing.
